Blige, The Winans, Take 6, Marcus Miller, Donald Lawrence, Nona Hendryx, Sandra St. Victor, Joyce Kennedy, Will Downing, and Gerald Albright Simone deserves among other things.&nbsp;She was also featured on Israel and New Breed’s 2006 Christmas album,&nbsp;</span><i><span>A Christmas Ever Timeless.</span></i></p><p><span>Aside from music, Lalah Hathaway is a breast cancer activist.&nbsp;She is one of the National Ambassadors for the Circle of Promise, a campaign launched by Susan G. Komen in October 2007.&nbsp;The campaign aims to heal, educate, empower and mobilize the African American community in the fight against breast cancer.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Married or married, who is Lalah Hathaway’s husband/boyfriend?</span></strong></h2><p><span>Now for the big question.&nbsp;But no way!&nbsp;Nobody gets Lalah Hathaway to talk about her relationships – boyfriend, husband, kids and all that stuff.&nbsp;Never!&nbsp;Journalists have tried several times, but Lalah’s usual response has always been, “No comment.”&nbsp;And so no one knows if Lalah has ever been married or not, if she has dated before or is currently dating someone.&nbsp;Nobody can tell.</span></p><p><span>However, rumor spread that Lalah had spotted engagement rings with a man believed to be her boyfriend.&nbsp;The pair were reportedly eyeing some expensive diamond rings at some jewelry stores.&nbsp;Well, we’ll pay attention and see what becomes of the story.</span></p><h3 class=main-box-title>You may also like</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGivmKR6qr%2BMpZilmZhitaLAx5qumrGjYrW2v8GapZ1ln6d6o7vYn6minZ6Zeqq%2FjKyfnmWdlr%2BztcSdZKiqXZmutbXNoGSsp52avK%2Bxjg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./prahlad-modi.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Prahlad Modi?
