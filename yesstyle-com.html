The 'Discounts & Promotions' area has previously had promotions such as 'Buy 1, Get 1 Free', free gifts, or sheet masks for just $0.99. With some of their most popular products joining deals every day, you can save on the things you love.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Check the Homepage: </strong>On the YesStyle homepage, you can find the latest flash sales and promotions. From 50% off selected products to bestsellers and products YesStyle thinks you’ll love, the homepage has the biggest and best YesStyle bargains. &nbsp;We’d also recommend checking the top bar of the page for the occasional flash discounts on selected products. These YesStyle deals are time-limited and have included up to 15% off before.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Join The Elite Club: </strong>This is a four-level loyalty program from YesStyle that allows you to earn points on your orders.&nbsp;When you join with your email address, you’ll be given a first-order coupon code. You’ll also earn 1 point per $1 spent. You can earn more points by writing a review, downloading the app, or referring a friend.&nbsp;At the highest loyalty level, you can earn 10 points per $1 spent and receive three 12% off coupons a year. It’s good to know that each loyalty program can earn points and qualify for a birthday gift too.</p><p><strong>Social Media Savvy: </strong>Easily find savings at YesStyle by following them on Facebook or Instagram. We’ve seen their Facebook offer social media promo codes such as 10% off your first order. Their Instagram usually has free skincare advice and style inspiration posts too.&nbsp;Give YesStyle a follow on social media and you’ll be kept updated on the latest flash sales and trending beauty products.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Friend Rewards: </strong>If you’re signed up for YesStyle’s loyalty program, you can earn more YS points by referring your friends. Once your friend uses your referral code, they will get 5% off their first order and then 2% off their next orders. YesStyle will then send you YS points as credit, which matches the amount your friend has saved on their order.&nbsp;However, it’s worth noting that YS points only last for three months. Make sure to use up your earned points before this time!</p><li>Choose your YesStyle discount code from this Marie Claire page.</li><li>Next, click the ‘Get Coupon’ button to see your code.</li><li>Click ‘Get Offer at YesStyle’ to continue to their website.</li><li>You will need to sign in or create a YesStyle account to add a promo code.</li><li>Start shopping and add your products to your bag.</li><li>Click the green ‘View In Bag’ button to go to the checkout.</li><li>Find the ‘Coupon or Rewards Code’ box.</li><li>Copy and paste your YesStyle promo code into the Coupon Code box.</li><li>Click ‘Apply’ to add your YesStyle code to the order.</li><li>Continue to Payment to complete your order.</li><h2 id=how-we-source-our-codes-xa0-3>How We Source Our Codes&nbsp;</h2><p>At Marie Claire, we have a dedicated team of deal experts, commercial colleagues, and editors who find and negotiate the best promo codes and coupons, as well as produce content aiming to help you shop affordably.&nbsp;</p><p>We have a dedicated team of 3 deal experts that are constantly sourcing and testing coupons and promo codes for some of the biggest retailers in fashion, beauty, and beyond to list on our website.
