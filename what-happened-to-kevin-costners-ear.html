What is clear, however, is that Kevin Costner’s talent and contributions to cinema far outweigh any fleeting curiosity about his physical appearance. As an accomplished actor, director, and producer, Costner’s enduring presence in Hollywood is a testament to his skill and dedication to his craft, rather than the condition of his ear.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qq3MoKalnKCWu6WtjZympmenna61eceap6mdnpqxbsDOZqKerpmjeqS70q2lnqqjYrKivo4%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./what-is-behavioral-momentum-in-aba.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What is behavioral momentum in ABA?">&larr;
