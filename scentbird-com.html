In the past, they've had 50% off as well as a free case for new customers. We’d recommend checking the terms and conditions as some ‘free trials’ have been known to charge for shipping.</p><h3>Does Scentbird have free shipping?</h3><p>You can get free shipping at Scentbird on all subscription orders. However, Scentbird advises processing subscription orders is currently taking an extra 3 business days than usual. One time orders cost $3 for shipping and should be shipped within 5-7 business days.</p><h3>Does Scentbird have a student discount?</h3><p>Yes, Scentbird offers up to 50% off your first box with their student discount. &nbsp;Verify your student status using Student Beans to get your discount. We’d recommend checking the first-order promotions available at the time, as some first-order promotions have been up to 60% off before.</p><h3>Are there any Scentbird app discounts?</h3><p>There does not appear to be any app-exclusive promotions right now, but if this changes we'll be the first to let you know. Alternatively, you can use one of our handy Scentbird coupons to help you save on your future purchases.&nbsp;</p><h3>Can I gift a perfume subscription from Scentbird?</h3><p>Certainly! If you know somebody who loves perfumes, then a perfume subscription is a fantastic gift. You can give them a Scentbird digital gift card and choose either $50, $75, $100 or $200. They can then use this towards a Scentbird subscription and choose their own fragrances.</p><h3>How can I get a Scentbird coupon code?</h3><p>To get a Scentbird coupon code, we would recommend checking our website regularly. We update our coupon codes often, so check back again if you don't initially find the coupon code of your dreams.</p><h3>What is the returns policy at Scentbird?</h3><p>Scentbird has a 15 day return period for any unused, full-sized perfumes or gift sets. However, they do not accept any returns on Scentbird subscription products unless faulty. If your order is faulty, your items can be replaced within 30 days of when they were delivered.</p><h2 id=hints-and-tips-3>Hints and tips</h2><p><strong>Newsletter Offers: </strong>Sign up for the Scentbird newsletter to make extra savings on your orders. In the past, Scentbird has offered 50% off your first order along with a free case for your perfumes. This means that your first month is reduced from $16.95 to only $8.47.&nbsp;There are usually discounts you can find throughout the year, so it's definitely worth signing up to find out more.</p><p><strong>Scentbird Subscriptions: </strong>Save more when you sign up for a Scentbird subscription. &nbsp;If you regularly buy expensive full-sized perfumes, then a subscription service could save you on your orders. As well as saving on your perfume, you can try different scents and find the ones that suit your individuality the best. First subscription orders have previously had discounts of 35 - 65% off, with the offers usually being limited-time deals.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Seasonal Sales:</strong> Shop all the latest seasonal promotions at Scentbird on their homepage. Previous homepage promotions have included seasonal discounts such as Valentine’s perfume offers, and more. If you’re new to Scentbird, this is where you can usually find a subscription saving for joining.&nbsp;You can also find the latest Scentbird deals on this page too, which we update regularly with the newest sales and promo codes.</p><p><strong>Refer-a-Friend</strong>: Refer friends or family who would love Scentbird and gift them a free monthly subscription. Once your friend places an order using your code, they should receive a free month of Scentbird as credit to their account. The best part is, you'll also be sent a free monthly Scentbird subscription for referring your friend.&nbsp;Now that's an offer that's too good to refuse.</p><p><strong>Scentbird Socials: </strong>Follow Scentbird on social media If you’re looking for the latest ways to save on seasonal scents. You can usually find the latest promotions and sales on their pages, alongside helpful informative posts about the differences in scents too.&nbsp;Now and then, Scentbird might also give their followers an exclusive promo code too. We’d recommend Instagram for regular promotions and the occasional giveaway to their followers.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Free Shipping on Subscriptions: </strong>Enjoy free shipping at Scentbird included with each subscription. Your order will be shipped during the middle of the month, so it will arrive at the end of each month. For all other orders, shipping costs $3.00. Whilst this is an affordable charge, a subscription avoids these small charges.</p><h2 id=how-to-use-your-scentbird-coupon-3>How to use your Scentbird coupon</h2><li>Choose your Scentbird promo code eligible for your order.</li><li>Click the ‘Get Deal’ button to reveal your Scentbird promotion.</li><li>Then, click ‘Get Offer at Scentbird’ to go to their website.</li><li>Create an account or sign up for Scentbird.</li><li>Click ‘Add to Cart’ on your monthly subscription or products.</li><li>Click the bag icon in the top right corner then ‘Checkout’.</li><li>Most Scentbird promo codes should automatically be added to your bag.</li><h2 id=how-we-source-our-codes-3>How we source our codes</h2><p>At Marie Claire, we have a dedicated team of deal experts, commercial colleagues, and editors who find and negotiate the best promo codes and coupons, as well as produce content aiming to help you shop affordably.&nbsp;</p><p>We have a dedicated team of 3 deal experts that are constantly sourcing and testing coupons and promo codes for some of the biggest retailers in fashion, beauty, and beyond to list on our website.

If this happens, be sure to contact us by emailing <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=#>coupons.marieclaire@futurenet.com</a>&nbsp; so we know.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=how-do-we-make-money-xa0-3>How do we make money?&nbsp;</h2><p>It’s completely free for customers to use the coupon codes we have above. We’ll get a small percentage of the money spent as a commission from the retailer you shop at. As with most businesses, we do need to make money however this will never impact the price you pay. The brand will give us a small share of the profit for connecting you to them. This helps us keep going whilst saving you more money.</p><p>Simply put, the retailer makes a sale, we get a commission, and you get a discount.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RopycpJGev6Z6wqikaJufqr2wutJoqpydnqmvqr7DZ5qopQ%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./shawn-coon-death-what-was-shawn-coon-cause-of-death-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Shawn Coon Death What Was Shawn Coon Cause Of Death">&larr;
