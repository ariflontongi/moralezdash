The flowers are blooming and birds are singing in a way that she can't help but appreciate the beauty around her. After two birds with red heads and yellow bodies build a nest nearby, Karana watches the pair take turns sitting on their eggs.<h2>Is Island of the Blue Dolphins a true story?</h2>Island of the Blue Dolphins is a work of historical fiction based on the life of an American Indian woman who spent 18 years in isolation on San Nicolas Island, one of eight Channel Islands off the coast of Southern California.<h2>How long does Karana stay in her new house until her leg heals?</h2>Instead of trying to make it home, Karana crawls into a cave near the spring, where she stays for six days, only leaving to get more water, until her leg is healed and she can walk.<h2>What kind of dog is Rontu?</h2>Rontu is the former pet of the Aleutian hunters. "He was a much larger dog than any of ours," Karana tells us, "which besides have short hair and brown eyes. I was sure that he was an Aleut dog" (15.3). Rontu used to belong to the Aleut.<h2>How did Karana get a new dog after Rontus death?</h2>How did Karana get a new dog after Rontu's death? She put a mixture into the spring water to make the dogs go to sleep. Their ship had sunk in the storm, then their was no other ship.<h2>Why do you think Karana adopted the two baby birds What did she name them?</h2>Karana names the larger of the two birds Tainor, after a young man she liked that was killed by the Aleuts; she names the smaller one Lurai, which is the name she would have liked instead of Karana.<h2>What happens to Karana at the end of the novel?</h2>Two more years pass and Karana finally gets her happy ending. A ship full of white men arrive on the island. Though Karana doesn't speak their language, she understands that they will take her to safety. She packs up her pet birds and Rontu-Aru, and she leaves for the mainland.<h2>What happened in chapter 28 of island of the Blue Dolphins?</h2>The huge waves destroy Karana's canoe and those she had stored under the cliffs. Karana looks among the wreckage left by the waves to find wood to build a new canoe. She retrieves parts of canoes washed ashore and collects enough wood to make a new vessel.<h2>What happens in chapter 27 of island of the Blue Dolphins?</h2>Karana soon sees a huge wave (tsunami) coming towards the island, and she runs to escape by climbing a cliff. She climbs as high as she can but is soaked by a second, larger ocean wave. Once the water retreats, Karana leaves the cliff for the safety of her shelter.<h2>What did Karana find in the chest?</h2>Karana searches for spearheads and weapons among the ashes of the village, in the canoes the tribe hid, and in the chest of beads that the Aleut hunters left.<h2>How did Karana get stranded on the island?</h2>Karana has been alone on the island for many years after she jumped off the ship that took her people to the mainland after realizing her brother had missed the same boat. A few days later, her brother is killed by wild dogs, and she is left alone on the island.<h2>What happened in chapter 10 of Island of the Blue Dolphins?</h2>Karana spends the summer watching for the ship to come back. But when winter arrives, she gives up hope. Karana becomes more and more lonely. After a storm hits the island, she decides to take one of the smaller canoes and go east across the ocean, to where her people have gone.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTnqmvoZWsrrOxwGeaqKVfm66ye8eormacn5rAbrfAq5inmV2csrV5yKehrqqVmQ%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./how-much-does-christopher-meloni-make-per-episode.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How Much Does Christopher Meloni Make Per Episode?">&larr;
