But the following week, he took to Twitter to reveal that he <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/geraldo-rivera-quits-fox-news-fired-the-five-1235526512/>actually quit his job at Fox News</a> after being “fired” from The Five.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">During Thursday’s appearance on <a href=# id=auto-tag_view data-tag=view>The View</a>, Rivera didn’t identify who he “had a toxic relationship” with, but when asked if he felt that it was unfair that personal issues with a colleague on the show led to his exit, he responded, “Sure.”</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“I also thought it was very unfair that I was not judged objectively in our disputes, but rather that he was always favored,” he explained. “I was the one…suspended three times. My appearances, I had two, three appearances scheduled weekly, then bi-weekly, then monthly, then they kind of disappeared, they were canceled in the last day right before I was supposed to go on. So, I was really ticked off.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">When prompted by The View co-host Joy Behar, Rivera did proceed to confirm that he was referring to a male castmember on The Five and not Jeanine Pirro, adding, “I love Jeanine.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The Fox News afternoon panel show featured a rotating cast of co-hosts from across Fox’s lineup, including Pirro, Jesse Watters, Dana Perino and Greg Gutfeld. Rivera would make appearances in the rotation as a liberal co-host.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">But in the end, he said, “Everything came to everything. Now I’m not mad at anybody. Now I’m a free person.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Earlier during his conversation on The View, Rivera also detailed how he ultimately ended up at his decision to leave the network as a whole.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“I got a call from two of the female executives and they said, ‘You’re off The Five, but there are plenty of other things you can do.'” he recalled. “I had a year and a half left on my contract. And I said, ‘Well, stuff it, if you fired me from the No. 1 show, then I’m going to quit.’ And that’s basically what happened.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">He continued, “In the interim, in the days that led up to my last day of work, they were so kind to me… They were so nice, remembering all the things we did together over the 20-odd years.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">When asked why they didn’t just build him another show, Rivera added, “They could have, I guess,” but that he feels like his “ideology does not fit Fox” anymore.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Rivera previously told <a rel=nofollow href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://apnews.com/article/fox-geraldo-rivera-five-gutfeld-6e0c60a67deedb1736a61592a8229046>the Associated Press</a> that there was friction in front of and behind the cameras on the Fox News panel show.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“There has been a growing tension that goes beyond editorial differences and personal annoyances and gripes,” he told the outlet in June. “It’s not worth it to me.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The Hollywood Reporter has reached out to Fox News for comment.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue9OvZq2uXaOyuL%2BOoJyrmZyZvG6%2ByK%2Bcq5ldp7K3scClqmasn622pHnRnqOarJmku7S0yKlkraCVYrOqwsRmmqhlo6mus3mQa2pubWNrf3GAjg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./how-do-i-do-ucc-search-in-georgia-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How Do I Do A Ucc Search In Georgia">&larr;
