Indeed, the 22-year-old also moonlights as a creative consultant, fashion guru, social media maven, member of <a href=# class=text-word rel>A$AP Mob</a>, roommate of <a href=# class=text-word rel>Fredo Santana</a>. With a rare existential confidence, a true DGAF attitude that rivals that of Tyler, the Creator, he has amassed a massive social following and earned consultant work with everyone from <a href=# class=text-word rel>Kanye West</a> to Kylie Jenner. Clearly, the self-described King of the Youth is doing something right.</p><p><br><h2>He got his start on Tumblr</h2></p><p>Everything You Need To Know About Ian Connor</p><p>Connor was born in New York and moved to Atlanta at age 9. Connor's current social media hegemony spans Twitter, Instagram, & Tumblr. It was Tumblr where he first made a name for himself. He used the site to promote his "L3NF"&nbsp;line of tees and sweatshirts, a&nbsp;collaboration with Glyn Brown, then blew up when designer Will Fry reproduced Connor's face Warhol-style across&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">one of his mesh tops</a>&nbsp;that would be worn by such rappers as <a href=# class=text-word rel>Trinidad James</a>. It&nbsp;wasn't long before streetwear brands like Lumières, Stussy, & Bape started contracting Connor for model work.</p><p dir=ltr>Trust Nothing but Your Clothes.</p>— Ian Connor (@Souljaian) <a href=#>December 6, 2014</a><h2>He's A$AP Rocky's creative director and Rocky is his manager</h2><p>Everything You Need To Know About Ian Connor</p><p>Connor eventually worked his way into the inner circle of A$AP Mob by way of Rocky's best friend, A$AP Bari. In an <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">interview with Complex</a>, Connor describes the process of gaining acceptance w/ the Mob:</p><p>"I chased behind Bari like a fucking dog, like, ‘Hey, what's up, Bari?' All the time. I'd be like, ‘When we hanging?' And he'd be like, ‘I'm not hanging out with you today, little *****.' I'd be like, ‘Aw, fuck you!' But still follow him around. I'd take pictures of him as he was walking away. I looked up to Bari so much until we were inseparable."</p><p>Conner explained what drew him to Bari: "Bari was that fashion nigga. I knew he wasn’t rich but he had rich clothes. He was a true, I-don’t-give-a-fuck-type nigga, and I was like that too. Even if I didn’t have a home, I was sleeping on the floor, I always made sure I had my clothes."</p><p>While Rocky now manages Connor, Connor serves as Rocky's creative director. He's taken liberties within the role, starting beef with the likes of Travi$ Scott on Rocky's behalf when Rocky wants nothing to do with it. "Travi$ [Scott] No. 1?" <a href=# rel>said</a> Connor. "Who influenced Travi$? Who’s the father? Rocky. A$AP Mob. Nast. Ian Connor. Illz. Bari."</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Oh Word? <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">pic.twitter.com/WtE6de7RAY</a></p><p>Everything You Need To Know About Ian Connor</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>I feel like Ian Connor and carti just slap box in random art lofts all day, everyday</p><p></p><p><h2>He's on Kanye West's creative team</h2></p><p>Everything You Need To Know About Ian Connor</p><p><span>When he was 19, Connor received a text from Virgil Abloh, Kanye West's creative director, and they've been in touch ever since. Abloh is a role model of sorts to Connor's role model A$AP Bari, so by the transitive property, Connor looked up to Abloh as well.</span></p><p><span>"It’s your father’s father, so you automatically gotta fuck with your grandfather," he explained in an interview with <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">SSense</a>.</span></p><p>In 2015, Abloh and Kanye invited Connor to work with them as a creative consultant. Connor modeled for both the rollout of <a href=# class=text-word rel="nofollow noopener">Yeezy</a> Seasons 1 & 2; at the later while the rest of the models stood still and tall, Connor slouched, smoking a cig and scrolling through his phone. A signature moment.</p><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Ok Cool, What's Next?</a></p><p>A video posted by Ian Connor (@ianconnorsrevenge) on Sep 16, 2015 at 12:28pm PDT</p><h2>He's styled for Wiz Khalifa and Kylie Jenner</h2><p>Everything You Need To Know About Ian Connor</p><p>While Connor briefly held the title of creative director to Wiz Khalifa, this past fall he moved on to an even more high-profile client: Kylie Jenner. Connor has also landed himself numerous consulting gigs, working with such notable streetwear brands as Emotionally Unavailable, Pink Dolphin, & FourTwoFour.</p><p>As he considers Bari to be his "father," Connor has a protege whom he considers to be a "child" of his own: 20-year-old Shane Gonzales, fashion designer and founder of Midnight Studios.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Got The Kylie Jenner Styling Job, Got The Yeezy Season 2 Styling - Modeling Job, Manage and Got Carti Signed.

"I find them really amusing and interesting. I couldn’t say a specific serial killer cause there are pros and cons for each. Serial killers and people behind the scenes. You’ve got your rap artists but at the same time you have the people with the brains that work with the artists, mentally training them. Those are the people I look up to.
