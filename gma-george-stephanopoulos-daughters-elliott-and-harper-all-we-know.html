So what is known about Elliott and Harper? Read on to get to know George's daughters.&nbsp;</p><h2>Eliott Anastasia Stephanopoulos&nbsp;</h2><p id=ewXeih4dB8 data-wc=69>Elliott was born on September 9 2002, just a year after George and Ali got married. The 21-year-old is currently a student at Brown University, and is now living in London as part of the college's study abroad program. Elliott has mainly kept away from the spotlight, but has been referenced by her parents on their social media accounts, as well as on Ali's popular podcast, .&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/abcc436886b1-snapinstaapp413381016220708731083802321363611926842563n1080-1.jpg><p id=ekQLY3NaqU data-wc=89>Most recently, she made her TV debut on , as she helped the crew backstage while George was on London reporting on Princess Kate's cancer battle. George told his co-anchors <a class=hm-link href=#>Robin Roberts</a>, Michael Strahan and Rebecca Jarvis during a live report from London: "Hey guys before you go, I have a special PA [production assistant] here in London today." Elliott then briefly popped into the screen and gave a wave before quickly jumping out of frame, prompting George to say: "Oh no she got shy very fast!"&nbsp;</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="George Stephanopoulos bravely returns to GMA days after upsetting family death" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/da71e08490ed-gettyimages-1249066125.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="George Stephanopoulos bravely returns to GMA days after upsetting family death" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>George Stephanopoulos bravely returns to GMA days after upsetting family death</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="George Stephanopoulos' wife shares poignant update following family's difficult time" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/0bc0f50b8186-snapinstaapp44628074714121289594925258096639037414403054n1024.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="George Stephanopoulos' wife shares poignant update following family's difficult time" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>George Stephanopoulos' wife shares poignant update following family's difficult time</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="George Stephanopoulos is delighted by new GMA co-star's presence during difficult week" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/e3f8f6bff4c1-george-stephanopoulos-gma.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="George Stephanopoulos is delighted by new GMA co-star's presence during difficult week" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>George Stephanopoulos is delighted by new GMA co-star's presence during difficult week</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><p id=e-NkqE4mcmu data-wc=46>She then jumped back in for another brief "hi" to the delight of her dad's co-hosts, as he joked: "I decided to put her to work today," while smiling ear-to-ear, and Robin quipped: "It's great to see even a glimpse of her… enjoy your time there."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/b899c96f38d5-ali-wentworth-with-her-daughters.jpg><p id=eRptZf5Xzm data-wc=63>Elliott's move to college, especially as she was the oldest daughter, was tricky for her parents. She went off to Brown's University late because she tested positive for Covid on the day she was due to go. At the time, the rules meant she had to stay in isolation for ten days, giving Ali and George some extra time with her at home.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/3166db480dc8-george-stephanopoulos-throwback-photo.jpg><p id=emARbqdV1w data-wc=87>Ali explained on her podcast: "So the two of us literally sat there for ten days going, Well what if we really miss each other?,' 'What if I come and visit you?,' 'What if I want to come home?,' 'What if I cry all the time?,' What if I don't make friends?' and we literally got through every scenario and so by the time I took her to college, we had our own weird therapy group together to comfort each other. Now she's really thriving at college."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/1d791983da3d-george-stephanopoulos-ali-wentworth-family-change-z.jpg><p id=es8Udt8-A8 data-wc=70>In 2017, George and Ali both paid tribute to Elliott as they revealed to the public that she had scoliosis. At the time, the pair shared a collage of photos of Elliott wearing her brace, with both posting messages on their respective social media accounts. Ali wrote: "So proud of my daughter wearing her brace every day!" George tweeted: "So proud of my daughter Elliott. Wearing a brace every day."&nbsp;</p><h2>Harper Andrea Stephanopoulos&nbsp;</h2><p id=eY2LVmnOFv data-wc=79>Harper was born on June 2 2005, and is studying in Nashville at Vanderbilt University. George's co-star Lara Spencer also has her daughter, Katharine, studying at the same college. Harper is the baby of the family, which made her move to college all the more difficult for her parents. When she left in August 2023, Ali wrote on Instagram: "We dropped our baby off at college. Everyone is saying 'she's ready to launch'! But… I don't think I'm ready!&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/86004ad96739-george-stephanopoulos-and-ali-wentworth-daughter.jpg><p id=eEbWwGxCpv data-wc=65>"I don't want to stop making pasta with vodka sauce, picking up wet towels, cuddling up to her familiar scent. As Joni Mitchell once wrote – 'the bed's too big, the frying pan too wide'." She continued: "I know our daughter will thrive. But man, it's brutal on the parents. If you feel inclined – please send me baked goods. I'll be under my covers."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/1c57863d9aca-ali-wentworth-george-stephanopoulos-college-prep.jpg><p id=e7E182PAf1 data-wc=78>Harper's personality was revealed by her mom Ali in a sweet tribute message just before she left home. During her high school graduation, the Ali's Well that Ends Well author wrote: "The baby daughter is launched! A perpetually optimistic, joyful, generous, empathetic, fun-loving, and wise human is spreading her wings! Bursting with love and pride! P.S. You know she is my daughter because she ran out after she graduated and got an ice cream cone across the street."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/2d836b1e6955-snapinstaapp3512471759409841338773407003672827882286916n1080.jpg><p id=exQRkohlSa data-wc=51>Harper, along with her sister Elliott, have made several red carpet appearances with their famous parents over the years at special events. Most recently in 2023, they joined their mom and dad at their film 's premiere in New York City.
