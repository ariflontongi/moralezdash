"It was somebody we knew that was really on her team," she began. "They're like, 'Yeah, she wants you on ["MY POWER"].' I was like, 'Alright, send the song.' 'Oh it comes out in two days, too,' and it's like... Whoo! So, we played the song, and I was like, 'Alright, this beat's cr*zy.' I wrote the verse in, like, 20 minutes. We were looking at each other like, 'Is it good?' It came so easy. We didn't want a rush a song with <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Beyonce</a>. We don't want to rush any song, but a song with Beyonce? You gotta be careful.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"So my verse, it was an open slot for the last verse," Tierra Whack continued. "We sent it over, and it's like, 'Yo, <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">she likes it so much, she's gonna put it as the opening</a>.' I was like, 'Oh s**t, right, that's cr*zy, yo, n***a, we made it!' Yeah. I never told anybody this, but I'ma tell y'all this. We sent our rough, and then we were like, 'Yo, before it comes out, we need to hear what the engineers are doing on that side, 'cause we wanna make sure and just be comfortable,' right? We don't want to hear no effects and stuff. So they sent it back last-minute, Somebody on that side sent it back and... my verse was off. Like, off-beat. It made me sound like I didn't know how to rap.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-tierra-whack-reveals-how-meek-mill-saved-her-amp-beyonce-s-track-my-power-watch>Tierra Whack Reveals How <a href=# class=text-word>Meek Mill</a> Saved Her & Beyonce's Track "MY POWER": Watch</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"I was so hurt, and I was like, 'Yo, I don't want to seem ungrateful, I don't wanna like...' You know what I'm saying? I know how to rap," Tierra Whack went on. "Yeah, I said something. It took me a few hours, 'cause I wanted to just make sure I said it right. So, I didn't get that right contact to her. I think Hov switched his number, he had a new number. By the time I texted him, it went green. But I have his number today, so yeah, I got it. <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">I'm good, I'm still in, I'm still cool!</a> Um... so, I had to communicate, right? So, what I did was I reached out to Meek. You know, Meek, that's like my cousin. No, like, real cousins.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"So <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">I reached out to Meek</a>, I'm like, 'Yo, this happened. And I need you to say it for me,'" she concluded. "So he hit Hov, and I guess Hov tapped B, like, 'Yo, Whack saying this verse is not right.' And then she made a few phone calls, and it was over with. It was good, it was all figured out. Then Hov hit me and he's like, 'I'm glad you spoke up, because your s**t gotta be right.' But the whole world at this moment, y'all know I can rap. But, I was like, I gotta be [right]. No, I was like, 'Does this engineer have ears?' It was so bad, like, it was so off. I change flows like three times, so it all has to match."

He started in 2022 as a weekend writer and, since joining the team full-time, has developed a strong knowledge in hip-hop news and releases. Whether it’s regular coverage or occasional interviews and album reviews, he continues to search for the most relevant news for his audience and find the best new releases in the genre. What excites him the most is finding pop culture stories of interest, as well as a deeper passion for the art form of hip-hop and its contemporary output. Specifically, Gabriel enjoys the fringes of rap music: the experimental, boundary-pushing, and raw alternatives to the mainstream sound. As a proud native of San Juan, Puerto Rico, he also stays up-to-date with the archipelago’s local scene and its biggest musical exponents in reggaetón, salsa, indie, and beyond. Before working at HotNewHipHop, Gabriel produced multiple short documentaries, artist interviews, venue spotlights, and audio podcasts on a variety of genres and musical figures. Hardcore punk and Go-go music defined much of his coverage during his time at the George Washington University in D.C. His favorite hip-hop artists working today are Tyler, The Creator, Boldy James, JPEGMAFIA, and Earl Sweatshirt.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdnbIJ5gJJmq6KdoqeubsPHmpqkZZ2asqx5zKKjpWWSmsawusKeZKOZqWLHbrTIqWShp6Biu6bD0g%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./what-is-the-heartland-theory-ap-human-geography-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What is the heartland theory ap human geography ?">&larr;
