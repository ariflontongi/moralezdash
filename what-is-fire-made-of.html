A candle flame will primarily be a mixture of hot gases (air and vaporised paraffin wax). The oxygen in the air reacts with the paraffin to produce heat, light and carbon dioxide.</span></span><h2>What is fire actually made of?</h2>Flames consist primarily of carbon dioxide, water vapor, oxygen and nitrogen. If hot enough, the gases may become ionized to produce plasma. Depending on the substances alight, and any impurities outside, the color of the flame and the fire's intensity will be different.<h2>What state of matter is fire?</h2>Like a gas, it expands to fill the volume in which it's contained, whereas a flame does not. But what we can conclude (for now) is that, of the fundamental states of matter, fire is most like a plasma.<h2>What is the formula of fire?</h2>Fire's basic combustion equation is: fuel + oxygen —> carbon dioxide + water, a line many of us had drummed into us by school teachers. However, combustion reactions do not proceed directly from oxygen to carbon dioxide.<h2>What are the 3 material of fire?</h2>Oxygen, heat, and fuel are frequently referred to as the "fire triangle." Add in the fourth element, the chemical reaction, and you actually have a fire "tetrahedron." The important thing to remember is: take any of these four things away, and you will not have a fire or the fire will be extinguished.<h2>What Is Fire?</h2><p></p><h2>Can fire exist without oxygen?</h2>Air is made-up of about 21% oxygen, 78% nitrogen and less than 1% other gases including carbon dioxide and water vapor. Fire only needs about 16% oxygen to burn. Without oxygen, fires won't burn.<h2>How fire is created?</h2>Fire is the result of applying enough heat to a fuel source, when you've got a whole lot of oxygen around. As the atoms in the fuel heat up, they begin to vibrate until they break free of the bonds holding them together and are released as volatile gases. These gases react with oxygen in the surrounding atmosphere.<h2>Who made the first fire?</h2>Today, many scientists believe that the controlled use of fire was likely first achieved by an ancient human ancestor known as Homo erectus during the Early Stone Age.<h2>Is fire a gas Yes or no?</h2>Fire is a plasma, not a gas or a solid. It's a kind of transient state between being composed of the elements prior to ignition and the spent fumes (Smoke - solid particles and Gasses = Gas molecules.)<h2>Is fire matter Yes or no?</h2>The flame itself is a mixture of gases (vaporized fuel, oxygen, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, water vapor, and many other things) and so is matter. The light produced by the flame is energy, not matter.<h2>Does fire have a sound?</h2>The crackle of the fire is often used. But fires can snap, pop, roar and many other things.<h2>Does fire have weight?</h2>For most “everyday” fires, the density of the gas in the flame will be about 1/4 the density of air. So, since air (at sea level) weighs about 1.3 kg per cubic meter (1.3 grams per liter), fire weighs about 0.3 kg per cubic meter.<h2>What can fire not burn?</h2>Wherever any substance is put in fire it burns and changes into ash. But asbestos is one such material that does not burn in fire. That is why the fireman wear clothes made from asbestos when they enter the burning house.<h2>Is the sun made of fire?</h2>The Sun isn't "made of fire". It's made mostly of hydrogen and helium. Its heat and light come from nuclear fusion, a very different process that doesn't require oxygen.<h2>What are the 4 types of fire?</h2><p>Let's break down each of the 5 different classes of fires more thoroughly.</p><ul><li>Class A Fires: “Ordinary” Fires. ...</li><li>Class B Fires: Liquids & Gases. ...</li><li>Class C Fires: Electrical Fires. ...</li><li>Class D Fires: Metallic Fires. ...</li><li>Class K Fires: Grease Fires or Cooking Fires. ...</li><li>Choose the Right Fire Extinguisher. ...</li><li>Complete Regular Training.</li></ul><h2>Can fire be a liquid?</h2>Fire doesn't fall into liquid, because it doesn't have a fixed volume. Fire doesn't fall into solid, because it doesn't have a fixed shape.<h2>What is the 4th state of matter?</h2>Plasma, the fourth state of matter (beyond the conventional solids, liquids and gases), is an ionized gas consisting of approximately equal numbers of positively and negatively charged particles.<h2>Is plasma hotter than fire?</h2>Plasmas are gases in which a good fraction of the molecules are ionized. Ordinary flames ionize enough molecules to be noticeable, but not as many as some of the much hotter things that we usually call plasmas.<h2>Who invented humans?</h2>Homo sapiens<p>Anatomically modern humans emerged around 300,000 years ago in Africa, evolving from Homo heidelbergensis or a similar species and migrating out of Africa, gradually replacing local populations of archaic humans. For most of history, all humans were nomadic hunter-gatherers.</p><h2>How did humans get on earth?</h2>The first human ancestors appeared between five million and seven million years ago, probably when some apelike creatures in Africa began to walk habitually on two legs. They were flaking crude stone tools by 2.5 million years ago. Then some of them spread from Africa into Asia and Europe after two million years ago.<h2>How long have humans existed?</h2>Modern humans originated in Africa within the past 200,000 years and evolved from their most likely recent common ancestor, Homo erectus, which means 'upright man' in Latin. Homo erectus is an extinct species of human that lived between 1.9 million and 135,000 years ago.<h2>Can fire burn water?</h2>Because water cannot burn, fires cannot burn from within water, there is no ready supply of oxygen in a bucket of water (though, of course, there is oxygen in the air above the water) and thus, the water extinguishes the fire.<h2>Can a fire grow?</h2>The buildup of decaying organic matter on the ground is fuel for wildfires. Without periodic fire to clear this out, a naturally occurring fire may grow and move quickly, doing much more damage that a prescribed burn—and without its safety parameters.<h2>Why does fire hurt?</h2>It's basically adrenaline. Your body goes into a certain amount of shock. Once the burn becomes severe, it's burned down to the nerves so you don't initially have any sensation in those burned areas.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTnqmvoZWsrrOxwGeaqKVfm66ye9ahmK1lmah6p7XRnmSmmZSaerCy</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./what-is-the-torque-for-a-lawn-mower-blade-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What is the torque for a lawn mower blade?">&larr;
