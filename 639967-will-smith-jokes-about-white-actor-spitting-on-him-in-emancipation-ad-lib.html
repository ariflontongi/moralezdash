Since last year's violent display <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">at the Oscars</a>, Smith has been under scrutiny, but he's given his apologies and focused on his career. After taking time away from the spotlight to gather himself amid backlash, Smith tackled one of the heaviest films of his career: Emancipation. In Antoine Fuqua's film, he stars as Peter, an enslaved man inspired by the real-life "Whipped Peter" image.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Smith was bestowed the Beacon Award at the award ceremony, and during his speech, he touched on a spitting moment during filming. “‘Emancipation’ was the individual most difficult film of my entire career. It was all outdoors, that is true,” he joked as onlookers chuckled. “It’s really difficult to transport a modern mind to that time period. It’s difficult to imagine that, that level of inhumanity.”</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10">Will Smith's Costar Spat On Him</h2></span><p>CALIFORNIA, UNITED STATES - MARCH 1: Will Smith at the 14th Annual AAFCA Awards held at Beverly Wilshire, A Four Seasons Hotel on March 1, 2023 in Beverly Hills, California.

"It was the second day of shooting, and 110 degrees," he said. "I was in a scene with one of the white actors, and we had our lines, and the actor decided to ad-lib. So, we’re doing the scene. I did my line. He did his line. And then he ad-libbed and spit in the middle of my chest. If I had pearls on, I definitely would’ve clutched them. I wanted to say, ‘Antoineeeeee,’ but I stopped, and I realized that Peter couldn’t have called the director.”</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"I sat there, and I took a deep breath, and we did take two," Smith continued. His demeanor suggested the actor would try it again for the next take. "The actor felt that the ad-lib had gone well. So, we do take two. I do my line. He does his line and spits in the middle of my chest again. I just held in that moment, and there was a part—it makes me teary right now. There was a part of me that was grateful that I got to&nbsp;really&nbsp;understand. And then, in the distance, I hear a voice, and Antoine says, ‘Hey, let’s do a take without the spit.’" He joked, "And in that moment, I knew that God was real.”</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-grateful-to-apple-for-moving-forward>Grateful To Apple For Moving Forward</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"I want to thank Gil and AAFCA. I want to thank all of you in this room for doing what you do, keeping our stories alive," Smith further stated. "I want to thank Apple, because the budget was one thing. And then the budget was another thing. And then the budget was another thing.<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color"> And Apple never flinched. </a>It was the first time I had heard from a studio that the story was more important than how much it costs to get it done.
