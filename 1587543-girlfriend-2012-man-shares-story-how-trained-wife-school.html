When they first met in 2012, they fell in love as young <a href=#>people</a> and were hoping to kick off their relationship in earnest before they parted ways.</strong></p><p class=align-left>It's not that they broke up, as they had a strong desire to take their relationship to the next level, but Bassey's girlfriend, Endurance, relocated to another town. Bassey lived in Oron, <a href=#>Akwa Ibom state</a>, at the time they met. His girlfriend relocated to Eket, and this change of town almost ended their relationship.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/d549758f9c6c7e9b.png><p class=align-left>She was his first girlfriend, and he had her in his heart even when he, too, left Oron for Calabar to further his <a href=#>education</a>.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/5a6c6d209332896d.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Jnr Pope: Ruth Kadiri appreciates Regina Daniels, AGN for trying to save actor, "Stayed till 3 am"</span></p></a><p class=align-left>In an interview with <strong>Legit.ng,</strong> Bassey recalled:</p>"My wife was my first girlfriend in life (2012) as an adolescent, and just when we were trying to get more serious, she left Oron town to Eket to finish Secondary school, while I left for Calabar for further studies. Just 2020, fate brought us together again, and we had to continue our relationship, and this time, I couldn't let her go anywhere by engaging her; then she started school, and then we got married on 7th September 2023."<h2>How man sent his girlfriend to school</h2><p class=align-left>After they were reunited, Endurance expressed a strong desire to still go to school as she only completed her secondary education.

So, the seed of trust kept germinating and today yielding good fruits to my life."<p class=align-left>Even though he was not afraid, some people cautioned him that he was taking a big risk by training another man's daughter in school with the hope of getting married to her.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/3ed29e35991dac8d.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>“I'm committed to moving forward with grace”: AY’s wife Mabel confirms end of their marriage</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Bassey, however, said he did not see the risk:</p>"Definitely, I was severely cautioned and discouraged through direct and indirect manner of expressions, and my family and best friend were cool with the project.
