Nigerian men could be stringent when it comes to the specifications they lay down with the women they want to marry.</strong></p><p>All women are beautiful and appealing to Nigerian men; however, not all of these women are qualified enough to be married. Ask men. They know the ladies they turn to when it is time for them to ease the pent up sexual tension they have stored in their bodies and they know those they call when it is time to enter the clubs and have fun recklessly.</p><p>As much as people think men do not have pay attention to certain things, they have standards with which they operate and have qualities they expect their future partners to possess. Some Nigerian men would encourage some ladies to go bad or train them to be wild, yet they know they could never settle down for women like that because they have goals and objectives too.</p><p>The ladies they toy with are basically women that help them pass the time; they are women that are flexible and have little or no strong moral codes. If you have direction as a woman, a man should not have to toss you from side to side. Find below the types of women Nigerian men want to marry:</p><p class=h3>1. Home keeper</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt5ccekgirdbd.jpg><p>Nigerian men love to marry women who can help them run their homes. Women they can leave the affairs of their homes to; they would help them run and manage their properties in their absence and would add value to their lives.</p><p>Women that are home keepers would raise children the right way and instill core values and morals into their lives at the same time. Men feel more relaxed knowing they have women like that in their lives. Women like these are family oriented.</p><p><strong>READ ALSO:</strong>&nbsp;10 levels of disappointment every Nigerian youth goes through</p><p class=h3>2. Women they chase hard</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt3bas433ph9i.jpg><p>Women like that do not fall cheaply into men’s traps. They are virtuous women who know what they want in men and would only settle down with one that has matching dreams and goals with them.</p><p>Men recognize the potentials embedded in women like these and would do anything to make them theirs. Women like that are considered treasure mines.</p><p class=h3>3. Ladies that are intelligent</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt71kl6vl9njd.jpg><p>Honestly, no man wants to marry a dummy. Men love women who are smart and intellectually challenging. Women like these fit into organizational role and would rise fast in their chosen fields of career.</p><p>However, men who are not as sound as them may feel intimidated by them and keep off as their ego would always be bruised. Men are naturally proud; they would no doubt want to be in control of women like these knowing how much respect the women like that command in the society.</p><p class=h3>4. Ladies who are genuine</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt52bp6c6151d.jpg><p>Some ladies are honest and genuine; when they love, they love in totality. Ladies like these are rare considering how much importance ladies attach to materialism now.</p><p>Men want to marry ladies who they know would stick with them through thick and thin. They do not have to worry about the ladies cheating while they are trying to hustle and make something out of their lives.</p><p class=h3>5. Ladies who are not afraid to invest in them</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt1d2a6is5sj6g.jpg><p>Men appreciate it when they meet women who are ready to invest in them. Ladies like these understand the concept of the word ‘team’ and do everything they could to make the men rise in the different fields they may want to explore.</p><p>Men know that ladies like these would go to any length in seeing them happy and would move mountains for them towards the fulfilment of their life goals.</p><p class=h3>6. Women that are appealing</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt2mbt0rve4uu.jpg><p>Beauty is in the eyes of the beholder; Nigerian men go for women who are appealing to them. Women like these may not necessarily be the most beautiful woman in the world but would have strong features that would suit the needs of the men.</p><p>Men also love it when they meet women who have just more than beauty. They know the traits possessed by the women could get transferred to their offspring so they choose carefully.</p><p class=h3>7. Consistent and dedicated women</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt6jg4d60h5si.jpg><p>Men love it when they meet women who are as dedicated and committed as they are. Women like these know it is not solely up to men to make relationships and marriages work.</p><p>They also contribute their own quota and are keen on the success of the union. Nigerian men want to marry women who would not stop doing that very thing that made the men fall in love with them in the first place.</p><p class=h3>8. Ladies that are not morally loose</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt5ah2bqso3gg.jpg><p>Most men try having their fill of sex with women before they get married; they tore clubs and go after chain of girls that will be ready to give them their cookies. Sometimes, men do not have to try so hard to find women who would be willing to share their beds with them.</p><p>However, they appreciate women who are not morally loose. The ladies may not necessarily be virgins; they know they could train the innocent ones until they become the ideal sexual partner they want.</p><p class=h3>9. Ladies that are classy</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt3bg7mi5rb2dg.jpg><p>Nigerian men love to marry women who fit their social status. They love it when they are seen with women who are classy; women who know how to dress and behave publicly.</p><p>Ladies like these do well when it comes to decorating the house and giving it a homey feel.

Women who have curves, hips and big busts are chosen over every other type of women out there. Some of them like the idea of having their hands full when they touch the women.</p><p>They do not want to feel bones when they touch or lie with these women; they would rather go for women that are fleshy. These ones would give them a bouncy feel whenever they lie with them.</p><p><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>How to disvirgin a girl</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkhXh8mHBqZmlgYsG6vMSsZLCnnZq7brrIoJyroZGjeq6xzWajqK6VYrqivtGyZaGsnaE%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./296372-21-savage-is-happily-in-love-with-mystery-woman-doesnt-miss-ex-amber-rose-news.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="21 Savage Is &amp;quot;Happily In Love,&amp;quot; Doesn't Miss Ex Amber Rose">&larr;
