After the chicken's neck is cut, the person who slaughters it must inspect the bird's internal organs. This is to determine if the chicken had any disease from which it would have died naturally within a year.<h2>Can Muslims eat beef?</h2>Lamb, beef, goat and chicken, for example, are halal as long as a Muslim kills them and offers a prayer. Fish and eggs are also halal. All products from pork, carrion and blood are forbidden (haram), as are all types of alcohol.<h2>Is McDonald's halal?</h2>None of our menu items are Halal. Our restaurant operations do not allow us to separate halal products from our regular McDonald's items nor can we ensure other products in the restaurant meet the standard required for halal designations.<h2>Can Muslims eat shrimp?</h2>This would include squid, octopus, mussels, and other similar sea creatures. However, many Hanafi scholars considered prawns and shrimp to be permissible because they have a vertebra and are considered “fish”, though they and other creatures such as crabs and lobsters are debatable within their school of thought.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTnqmvoZWsrrOxwGeaqKVfm66ye8KapWailazAbrHArWSbnZWb</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./cardi-b-offset-relationship-timeline.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Cardi B and Offset's Relationship Timeline">&larr;
