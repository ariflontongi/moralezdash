Even if you follow sports news religiously, it was easy to miss this one. However, it turns out that the legend was doing an <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">exhibition match against John Gotti III.</a> Overall, it was not a fantastic matchup, and the fanfare surrounding it was pretty minimal. That said, this turned out to be one of the most entertaining things that Floyd has been part of in a long time. Albeit, for all of the wrong reasons.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">As you can see in the clip below, the fight was stopped in the middle of the sixth round. This was all due to the fact that Gotti had placed Mayweather in an illegal hold. Moreover, there were reports of some heavy trash talk, as well as some antics from Gotti's side of the ring. Subsequently, after being told the fight was over, Gotti rushed at Floyd Mayweather and kept trying to box. This led to both camps entering the ring and fighting with one another. The Money Team was not about to let their guy get jumped, and Gotti paid the price.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-floyd-mayweather-stands-his-ground>Floyd Mayweather Stands His Ground</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Overall, it was a disgraceful showing from John Gotti III. Floyd Mayweather was simply going about the fight as normal and almost got sucker punched. However, Mayweather was ready for anything and got stanced up as soon as he saw Gotti rush over. Ultimately, this was a pretty bad look for his opponent, and the consequences have yet to be revealed. Either way, this was a pretty bad night for boxing as a whole.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Moving forward, it will be interesting to see what Floyd decides to do for his next fight. There are plenty of options out there. Between Jake Paul, Manny Pacquiao, and a whole host of others. Hopefully, he lets us know soon.
