"An Ice-T song, 'I'm Your Pusher,'" he revealed. Push was asked if Ice-T was aware of his influence. "You know what? I seen him standing outside of a hotel one day and I actually did tell him."</p><p>ATLANTA, GA - OCTOBER 15: Rapper Pusha T performs During It's Almost Dry Tour Phase 2 at Coca-Cola Roxy on October 15, 2022 in Atlanta, Georgia.(Photo by Prince Williams/Wireimage)</p><span><h6 class=has-small-font-size>Read More: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Pusha T On Drake’s Subliminal Disses: “I Love It”</a></h6></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">It was an unforgettable moment that Pusha T was grateful for. "I actually gave him <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">all his flowers,</a> right then and there, I had to," he added. So, what did Ice have to say about it?

The Los Angeles entertainer's reach has gone far beyond music, as he's now more recognized for his Law & Order character than his Gangster Rap days. In fact, he revealed he had to put his television filming on pause to make the Hip Hop 50th Grammy tribute.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Questlove calls me up </a>and he says, 'All right, you gotta come to L.A. this weekend… It's a big performance, I got you in the lineup,'" he recalled. "And I was still hesitant 'cause it's a long travel, But then he says, 'You don't want to be sitting at home watching this show, saying you should've been there. I was invited but I didn't show up.' And I got my Black a** on a plane."</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Erika Marie is a seasoned journalist, editor, and ghostwriter who works predominantly in the fields of music, spirituality, mental health advocacy, and social activism.
