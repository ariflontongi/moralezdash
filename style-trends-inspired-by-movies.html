From the moment Elle Woods took on "the man" in Legally Blonde and normalized what has come to be known as <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/fashion/hot-pink-trend/>Barbiecore</a>, to the cast of the cult classic Trainspotting bringing back new age grunge, films have been setting fashion trends since the introduction of the video camera.</p><p>Even some of the most memorable movie quotes have to do with fashion trends and the ensemble choices of some of our most favorite characters. For example, it was Wednesday Addams who famously said: "I'll stop wearing black when they make a darker color." It was Karen Smith from Mean Girls who let the world know that "on Wednesdays, we wear pink." And it was the devilishly stylish Miranda Priestly who reminded us that florals for spring is hardly "groundbreaking."</p><p>Whether entire costumes inspired generational fashion trends or simply gave an up-and-coming group of fashionistas the silent permission to play around with various styles, movies have been serving us some truly iconic fashion moments and (thankfully) show no signs of letting up.</p><h2 id=bold-matching-plaid-sets-3>Bold Matching Plaid Sets</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gV8Z5F5LyiE8SDJnWiaxVL-1920-80.jpg><p>The 1985 hit Clueless inspired a slew of fashion trends, including slinky slip dresses, laid-back athleisure and the quintessential, always-classic baby tee.</p><p>The look that Clueless is most known for inspiring, however, is the bold matching plaid set, especially when paired with knee-high socks and chunky heels.

Thanks to actor John Travolta's stellar dance moves, the three-piece polyester suit became the must-have club ensemble of the decade, changing the look of dance floors across the globe.</p><h2 id=black-and-white-checkered-vans-3>Black-And-White Checkered Vans</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iAax9DqNRXrqAzA5tB2n5C-1920-80.jpg><p>The movie Fast Times at Ridgemont High —as well as the subsequent CBS sitcom based off the film—inspired an entire generation of kids to rock their best preppy, stoner, devil-may-care ensemble. But no one character sparked a trend like Sean Penn's skateboard-loving Jeff Spicoli, who solidified the black-and-white checkered Vans as the "it" shoe of the 80s.</p><h2 id=the-beret-3>The Beret</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9cBRs6LpuqwHFR3wpqPdJN-1920-80.jpg><p>The classic 1967 film Bonnie and Clyde gave birth to the ride-or-die couple and solidified the beret as a fierce accessory for women (and men) around the world. <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://ew.com/movies/the-25-most-stylish-movies-of-all-time/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>According to Entertainment Weekly,</a> sales of the iconic hat soared from 5,000 to 12,000 per week in the French village shops where the beret originated as a direct result of the film.</p><h2 id=the-high-waisted-denim-look-3>The High-Waisted Denim Look</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/URWTTM7fp4fyi3qcdkQiJY-1920-80.jpg><p>Director Spike Lee's iconic 1986 film She's Gotta Have It inspired an entire generation of would-be hipsters with its unique statement pieces that, while not particularly groundbreaking today, certainly changed the fashion game.

So many of Hughes' films went on to define an entire generation of 80s kids, including 80s fashion.</p><h2 id=layered-mesh-and-lace-3>Layered Mesh And Lace</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GAx6XmvT6V7BwWvwAUhGSK-1920-80.jpg><p>The ultimate material girl embodied 80s fashion, so it's no surprise that the 1985 film Desperately Seeking Susan staring the pop icon set some serious 80s fashion trends. Whether she was pairing lingerie with religious statement pieces or tressing her already sky-high locks, Madonna inspired an entire generation of young women to push the fashion boundaries. Yet it was her chaotically decision to randomly layer mesh over lace that really set her apart as a fashion icon.</p><h2 id=pastel-gowns-3>Pastel Gowns</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/S8rqjwVFWqmaBPBaSNysRR-1920-80.jpg><p>The 2006 hit film Marie Antoinette inspired looks both on and off the red carpet, especially at the Palais des Festival in Cannes, France. But the style trend most set by this movie was the growing popularity of pastel gowns, including light purples, greens and blues. Viewers took the 8th-century inspired costumes of the film and turned them into chic, modern looks.</p><h2 id=the-party-gown-3>The Party Gown</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gwDbf2Dx9a3zyCiHXPCa7Q-1920-80.jpg><p>Grace Kelly was a natural beauty in every scene she acted in, and the 1956 film High Society was no exception.

Ali MacGraw, who played Jenny in teh film, originated from the fashion world—she was a former assistant to legendary&nbsp;Harper's Bazaar&nbsp;editor Diana Vreeland—and it certainly showed on set.</p><h2 id=trousers-for-women-3>Trousers For Women</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QTNudf7TGVbjvnNc88kWfi-1920-80.jpg><p>The incomparable Katharine Hepburn took zero prisoners on set of the 1940 film The Philadelphia Story, especially when she normalized high-waisted trousers for women. What was assumed to be strictly menswear served as a feminine, take-no-prisoners touch to Hepburn's style and liberated a generation of women who were still beholden to outdated fashion "rules."</p><h2 id=the-high-slit-dress-3>The High-Slit Dress</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fy8HUPTDLmT7vPgA9YrxVi-1920-80.jpg><p>The 1966 film Blow-Up had everything, including barely-there miniature dresses with thigh-high slits that seemed to defy gravity and all things science. German model Veruschka's quick cameo in a sparkly dress with a dramatic slit changed the fashion game.</p><h2 id=perfectly-tailored-three-piece-suits-3>Perfectly Tailored Three-Piece Suits</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/95yEUFNMz8CBYCCYE2UQbb-1920-80.jpg><p>The 1968 heist movie The Thomas Crown Affair solidified the late, great actor Steve McQueen as a fashion "it" man while simultaneously proving that every gentlemen needs a perfectly tailored, three-piece suit.

The entire cast serves us some truly iconic fashion moments, complete with large statement belts, leopard-print fur, gold high heels, chic berets and &nbsp;oversized sunglasses. But it was actress <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/tag/anne-hathaway/>Anne Hathaway</a>'s memorable tweed jacked and Chanel boots that truly made an impact in the fashion world.</p><h2 id=mini-skirts-and-kitten-heels-3>Mini-Skirts And Kitten Heels</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BmkTJPTXomuUKTFR7snLPH-1920-80.jpg><p>The 2004 hit Mean Girls gave us everything: Burn books! All things pink! Chokers! And, of course, a sea of miniature skirts paired with kitten heels. The coming-of-age high school film certainly ushered in a new wave of preppy chic, and we were here for it.</p><h2 id=cropped-cardigans-and-cargo-pants-3>Cropped Cardigans And Cargo Pants</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CMZp5TrP3j4Q7HHdtJPpGk-1920-80.jpg><p>The 1999 cult classic 10 Things I Hate About You is beloved for a reason, and the movie's fashion inspiration is certainly on reason why fans continue to watch the movie year after year. While the late, greater Heath Ledger was giving us his best bad boy grunge look, the women of the film were serving up platform flip-flops, cropped cardigans, printed tan tops and cargo pants. Talk about iconic (and a trip down high school memory lane).</p><h2 id=the-baby-doll-dress-3>The Baby Doll Dress</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XDet2cDzab8RpRgHBMqYuZ-1920-80.jpg><p>The adorable romantic comedy 13 Going on 30 was as playful as it was inspiring for those obsessed with fashion. Not only did <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/tag/jennifer-garner/>Jennifer Garner</a> end up wearing one of the most iconic dresses in rom-com history—the baby doll dress—her looks still continue to inspire new generations of young women.

Before Greta Gerwig's Barbie made history, Elle Woods was kicking legal butt and normalizing Barbiecore with her fierce, bright pink power suits and miniature dresses. Elle Woods crawled so Barbie could run, folks.</p><h2 id=feather-trims-and-silk-dresses-3>Feather Trims And Silk Dresses</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JqeJtxMGMGnNnaNmnHJ9mE-1920-80.jpg><p>The 1997 film Romy and Michele's High School Reunion was a masterclass in 90s fashion.

The film made the Gothic style trend cool again, inspiring millennial teens to "freshen up" with some undead makeup featuring pale faces, blood-stained lips and heavy, dark eye makeup. It was a mood.</p><h2 id=silk-couture-3>Silk Couture</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jDNF3ZvqyEkvV8dYBsqnyk-1920-80.jpg><p>I mean, does silk couture gowns ever go out of style?</p><p>It's hardly a surprise that the 2017 film Phantom Thread brought home both an Academy Award&nbsp;and&nbsp;British Academy Film Award for Best Costume Design—the fashion was simply breathtaking. The gowns highlighted in the movie were equal parts historically accurate and inspired by the good (and not so good) aspects of fashion, only making the film that much more inspirational.</p><h2 id=aggressively-unbuttoned-collared-shirt-3>Aggressively Unbuttoned Collared Shirt</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tnB9prwx9XcFaSFJFVEthn-1920-80.jpg><p>We have actor Richard Gere and his 1980 performance in American Gigolo to thank for the aggressively unbuttoned collard shirt trend.
