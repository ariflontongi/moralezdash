I adore you, mama.</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Investigating what caused Beni Johnson’s death</h2><p style=text-align:justify>In 2018, Beni received a breast cancer diagnosis. Two tumours were found in her right breast, which were removed, according to the doctors at the time. Doctors also discovered that she had a BR2 gene mutation, which put her at risk for developing cancer once more.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Since Beni started having breathing issues in February 2022, Bethel Church has been asking people to pray for her.</p><p style=text-align:justify>At the time, they wrote,</p><p style=text-align:justify>“Beni Johnson has been on a health journey to beat cancer, as many of you already know. She has made some progress as a result of our persistent prayer.</p><p style=text-align:justify>She endured a protracted battle with the illness, and the church announced on July 13 that she was receiving hospice care at home. They further clarified,</p><p style=text-align:justify>Here’s how things stand right now: Late last week, Bill, Beni, and their medical professionals decided it was time to stop using chemotherapy to fight her cancer and instead focus on symptom relief. Beni is now receiving hospice care at home.</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Twitter users pay tribute</h2><p style=text-align:justify>When people learned of Beni Johnson’s passing, Twitter was inundated with condolences. She was known as one of the leaders of the Bethel Church.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Some people mentioned how Beni had supported them or inspired them to pursue their aspirations in their tributes.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Sadly, Bill Johnson’s fake teacher wife passed away from cancer.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Johnson remarked once:</p><p style=text-align:justify>Well, God sent me this cancer to teach me patience, I hear people remark. He didn’t, in fact. As much as the message of forgiveness, healing is a part of the gospel. christianpost.com/news/beni-john…</p><p style=text-align:justify>Every cancer death is heartbreaking, and we should pray for the bereaved. We should also pray that God may use Beni’s passing to awaken Bill Johnson to the dangers of the false gospel he has been preaching for so long. May it lead him to true repentance and trust. christianpost.com/news/beni-john…</p><p style=text-align:justify>I recently learned that Beni Johnson had died. Regardless of our differences, I feel terrible for the Johnson family. Praying for Bethel Church, Bill Johnson, and his family. I’m asking for solace, courage, and peace. I also ask the Lord to grant them the ability to see the truth. 🙏🏽😔</p><p style=text-align:justify>Last night, Beni Johnson was accepted into heaven. The senior pastors of Redding, California’s outstanding Bethel Church are Bill and Beni Johnson. Let’s continue to pray for them!</p><p style=text-align:justify>We share the sorrow over her passing and the joy over her life with Beni Johnson’s family and friends.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Beni was a courteous, compassionate, and loving guy. I was originally inspired by her support to publish my book, The Power of Hope. Her life had a huge impact.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Despite the fact that many expressed sadness for Beni’s passing, several also mentioned that they didn’t truly have the same values as the Johnson family. Even more people expressed their desire that “the Lord would open their eyes to the truth” by sharing accounts of others who had similar meetings with the family and their religion.</p><p style=text-align:justify>I have learned that Bill Johnson’s (the leader of Bethel, Redding) wife Beni passed away from cancer yesterday.</p><p style=text-align:justify>My heart aches for the family at this time of despair. Please pray for the Lord to use their sorrow to lead people to repentance and trust in the real Jesus of the Bible. ❤️</p><p style=text-align:justify>Billy’s wife, Beni Johnson, passed away. Although that is incredibly tragic, it should be remembered that Bill employed a young 29-year-old woman who was newlywed and had a child. She had cancer that was completely curable, but she was told she lacked faith for going to the doctor. she came to a stop. A few months without death.</p><p style=text-align:justify>I’m deeply saddened to learn of the demise of Beni Johnson, Bill Johnson’s devoted wife from Redding, California. praying that God’s healing presence will be all around the family.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Our prayers are with Bill, the entire Johnson family, and the Bethel family as we mourn the passing of Beni Johnson.</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Information about Beni Johnson</h2><p style=text-align:justify>Beni’s name was connected to prayer and the Bethel Church’s goal. With the establishment of the Intercession Team and Bethel’s Prayer House, she fulfilled a role.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Johnson also gave the church a name to follow in order to achieve physical, spiritual, and emotional well-being. Her goal was to see God’s people live wholesome, liberated lives and to see them pave the way for the return of the earth to its distinct condition of wellbeing.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Her love for people, care for their welfare, and commitment to prayer also helped Bethel’s work achieve the essential breakthrough. A perfectly satisfied prayer might be used to describe her desire to see all of God’s people having fulfilling lives.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rrHDmpummpqisG%2B1zWifqK9dpa60v8SdZJqvka56o7HNomSjp5ijwLC6jJqqZqyYmnqku4yfpq6mlJq%2FbrvFZpmerJiauW6vx66pnKBdmbamv4yaq2ZuZ2KwsLrDqKOeppOawG6t0Z5km52Zo7Ruv8Snq2g%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./how-to-clean-earrings.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How to Clean Silver, Gold, and Diamond Earrings">&larr;
