Authorities suggested the tragic event may be a suicide, but Allison feels differently.</p><p>"He ran out of the house, saying that he was late for something. Who says, 'Oh? It's 6:30, time to jump off a big roof?'" Allison said on&nbsp;Unsolved Mysteries. "I kept saying there's something bigger. There's something going on.

She's spent a lot of time with that note, as did the FBI, just going through the note trying to figure out if there were any clues or anything else in there. She doesn't place any significance on the movie&nbsp;The Game. Rey liked a lot of different types of movies. He was just a guy who was interested in everything. If he had only ever left just that writing or if it was the only thing he had ever written randomly, then people would be a little bit more suspect. But this is what he did all the time. He kept so many journals full of random writing. Allison feels that she's been through all the journals just trying to find any clue that could help her figure out what happened to him, and she couldn't find any real or strong connections in&nbsp;The Game."</p><p>If you have information about Rivera's disappearance, visit unsolved.com.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RopycpJGev6Z6wqikaJulocG2vsRomGxrYmiCcoSVaKmesV2ntrex0ZpksKGWmnqiuMuiqqimXw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-apryl-jones-baby-father.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Apryl Jones' baby father?">&larr;
