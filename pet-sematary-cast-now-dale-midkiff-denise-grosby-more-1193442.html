When the Creeds’ cat gets hit on the busy road next to the family’s new home one day, Louis’ older neighbor Jud (Fred Gwynne) reveals an Indian burial ground that may be able to bring it back.</p><p>The cat returns, but there’s something noticeably sinister about it, and when the Creeds’ youngest child, Gage (Miko Hughes), gets hit by a truck on the same road, Louis ignores the warnings of others and buries his son in that same “sour ground.”</p><p>Written by King and directed by Mary Lambert, the film grossed more than $57 million at the box office before developing a cult following. Almost exactly 30 years after the original’s release, Paramount Pictures’ modern re-imagining of&nbsp;Pet Sematary, starring Jason Clarke, Amy Seimetz and John Lithgow, was released on April 5.</p><p>In addition to stars Dale Midkiff, Denise Crosby, and Miko Hughes, the film features Blaze Berdahl, who played the Creed’s daughter Ellie before going on to star in the ’90s kids show&nbsp;Ghostwriter&nbsp;and more recently voicing Cheetah in&nbsp;DC Super Friends. The Crucible.&nbsp;Actress Mara Clark, Michael Lombard and Kavi Raz round out the cast of the original film.</p><p>Read on to see what the stars of the original Pet Sematary have been up to since the 1989 film was released.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p><strong>Dale Midkiff (Louis Creed)&nbsp;</strong></p><img decoding=async width=1024 height=577 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/pet_semetary_then_and_now_dale_midkiff_-_h_split_2019.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p>Midkiff played the newest doctor at the University of Maine’s health center and a progressively desperate patriarch. Louis first turns to the pet cemetery when his daughter’s cat dies but returns against the warnings of others in hopes that he can bring back his son after a tragic accident.</p><p>Before starring as the head of the Creed family, Midkiff appeared off Broadway as well as in leading roles for several TV movies. Most notably he portrayed Jock Ewing in the Dallas prequel,&nbsp;Dallas: The Early Years, and Elvis Presley in the adaptation of Priscilla Presley’s book of the same name,&nbsp;Elvis & Me.</p><p>After appearing in the 1989 film, Midkiff starred in&nbsp;Falcon Down, opposite William Shatner and Judd Nelson, and in a handful of TV series.

The actor also appeared alongside Michael Douglas and Glenn Close in&nbsp;Fatal Attraction&nbsp;and in Francis Ford Coppola’s&nbsp;The Cotton Club, which starred Richard Gere, Diane Lane and Gregory Hines.
