Overall, he is an artist who has a great track record at this point. He arguably has a classic album under his belt, which puts him above countless artists. That said, he has been experimenting with his sound as of late and going outside of his comfort zone. In fact, his latest track is a very good example of this. So much so that most of you are going to be shocked he would even go this route.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Yes, that is right, Bryson Tiller is on the soundtrack to Paw Patrol: The Mighty Movie. Paw Patrol is one of the biggest franchises in the world when it comes to kids' entertainment. The new movie is dropping soon, and some big stars are taking part in the music. Tiller can be found on the track "Down Like That" which is a high-octane pop track that is a huge departure from his usual sound.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-bryson-tiller-delivers-high-octane-track>Bryson Tiller Delivers High Octane Track</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">With this song, we get some heavy guitars throughout that create some action and tension. Moreover, Tiller flexes his vocal chops with a powerful chorus that drives to the tune of the guitars. It is a song that will not appeal to his adult r&b fans. However, it will be a cool song for kids who want to feel totally immersed in the film. It's a fun time, and that is all that really matters.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Of course, this is not your typical Bryson Tiller song and that is by design. Instead, this is song that has been made with children in mind. That said, let us know what you think of the track, in the comments section below.
