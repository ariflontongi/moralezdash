And Ada loves Leon but will never say or admit it because of who she is and does. But her actions speak louder than words so its obvious she loves him in her own way.</p><h2>Who is Leon Kennedy married to?</h2><p>Kennedy is a former police officer of the late Raccoon City, agent for D.S.O and is a current member of Division Delta Codenamed:Anti-Virus. His wife is Claire Redfield.</p><h2>Who is Leon’s main love interest?</h2><p>Leon S. Kennedy maintains an uncanny relationship with Ada Wong throughout the series. For him to look the other way on Ada Wong’s illegal acts shows that Leon S. Kennedy must have some pretty strong feelings for her.</p><h2>Do Leon and Claire get together?</h2><p>There is no romance between Leon and Claire. A little bit of flirting at the beginning but Leon’s romance interest is obviously Ada.</p><h2>Who did Leon kiss?</h2><p>Accepted Answer. They kiss, but it’s not nearly as romantic because it happens really quickly and it seems like Ada was just trying to shut Leon up. Romantic or not, I think their story was way better shown in the remake than in the original version.</p><h2>Resident Evil 4 Remake vs Original – Leon’s One Liners & Memes Comparison (2005 Vs 2023)</h2><h2>Does Ashley fall in love with Leon?</h2><p>While this cheesy line is extremely dated, it confirms that Ashley is interested in Leon as more than a friend. Though Leon deftly turns her down, it is unsure where Leon and Ashley’s relationship stands, as the latter never makes an appearance after Resident Evil 4.</p><h2>Does Leon fall in love with Claire?</h2><p>Claire is a little sweet on Leon, and Leon is definitely happy that Claire is surviving, but it’s not anything I’d call a romance. There’s definitely a little attraction at the gate scene, but nothing wildly over the top. They’re two strangers who find a fortunate friend…</p><h2>Why did Leon and Claire break up?</h2><p>Resident Evil: Infinite Darkness’ final scenes sees Leon deciding to cover up the truth, in keeping with the government’s wishes and hoping to spare the fear it could inspire. Claire is left disgusted by his actions, and as she walks away, it appears his decision has marked the end of their friendship.</p><h2>Who is Ada Wong’s love interest?</h2><p>Leon S. Kennedy maintains an uncanny relationship with Ada Wong throughout the series.</p><h2>Who is Leon shipped with?</h2><p>That of course includes Leon Kennedy and Claire Redfield, the stars of Resident Evil 2, affectionately dubbed ‘Cleon’. And of course, Claire’s actor Stephanie Panisello from Resi2 Remake, Infinite Darkness, and Death Island knows all about your love for the two.</p><h2>Has Leon slept with Ada?</h2><p>Does Leon sleep with Ada? Ah, that one, actually, even this not shown in the game, but between RE4 and RE Damnation, they have slept together as Ada mentioned in Damnation as “that night together” and the RE scriptwriters have confirmed they have slept together “that night”.</p><h2>How old is Leon Kennedy in RE4?</h2><p>Leon Kennedy was 27 years old at the start of Resident Evil 4; his age hasn’t changed in the remake, therefore he’s the same as he was in the original Resident Evil 4 game or its Ultimate HD edition. Kennedy is 21 years old during the events of Resident Evil 2, 27 in Resident Evil 4, and 36 in Resident Evil 6.</p><h2>Why was Leon Kennedy late?</h2><p>Leon’s appearance was designed by Capcom artist Isao Ohishi. In the manual for the original version of Resident Evil 2, Leon is explained as being late to his job due to a fight with his girlfriend, which Kamiya later said was based on Kamiya’s own life.</p><h2>Who is Chris Redfield’s wife?</h2><p>– Jill Valentine is now Jill Redfield. Chris married her shortly after the events of RE5. She’s no longer a field agent, but is still at the BSAA as a bioweapons advisor in the New York City HQ.</p><h2>How old is Leon in re6?</h2><p>Leon’s last video game appearance was in 2013’s Resident Evil 6, where he’s now a Division of Security Operations agent. He was 36 years old at the time. Fortunately, he was alive and well towards the end, but players have not seen him in the two most recent Resident Evil games.</p><h2>Why didn t Leon give Claire the chip?</h2><p>But just as he’s trapped in his suit, Leon is trapped by his obligations to the government – obligations that compel him to hold onto the chip and keep the truth buried from the public.</p><h2>What is Ada Wong’s gender?</h2><p>Ada Wong is an American woman of Chinese descent.</p><h2>How old is Leon in RE2?</h2><p>Description. Leon was only twenty one during the events of RE2. After graduating from the police academy, he filed an application for assignment to the Raccoon City Police Department.</p><h2>Is Ada older than Leon?</h2><p>Ada is only three years older than Leon and Jill is a year younger than Chris. There aren’t any other official “pairings”, unless Sherry and Jake became an item – she’s six years older than him. Their relationship isn’t exactly a subtle one.</p><h2>What happens to Claire and Leon?</h2><p>Claire eventually escapes from the city through the Umbrella Corporation’s underground research complex along with Leon and Sherry, after the three of them manage to destroy Birkin. In the game’s epilogue, Claire leaves to continue her search for Chris, while Leon and Sherry are rescued by the U.S. military.</p><h2>Does Leon ever meet Ada again?</h2><p>I then show the first time she meets Leon after the incident in RE4 before finally they meet again in RE6 where Leon saves Ada from death.</p><h2>Is Claire or Leon canon?</h2><p>Both of them occur at the same time but from two different perspectives. Claire A/Leon B is the canon scenario, it was confirmed in later games, Darkside Chronicles to name one.</p><h2>Why does Leon sleep with sunglasses on?</h2><p>The idea for the sunglasses that Léon continuously wears – particularly at night, because ironically, they help him see in the dark – stems from director Luc Besson.</p><h2>Is Olivia in love with Leon?</h2><p>Unlike the main storyline, Olivia is actually happily in love with Leon; as in the game routes, she could not refuse the advances of the captured characters out of societal standing. She and Angelica eventually get engaged to Leon.</p><h2>Who does Claire sleep with?</h2><p>Claire slept with Lord John, and Jamie spent the night with the widow Mary MacNab, one of his tenants. They were also both pressured into sex by someone with power and authority over them. Claire slept with King Louis XV to get Jamie out of prison.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r6%2FErJpnm5%2BifKitzKKloGWWlr5ww8eoZKKrXaGysLqMpJynppWZxm64zq%2BcZqGeqbKzsdKtZg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-mark-fleischman-wiki-age-bio-net-worth-career-relationship-family-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Mark Fleischman?
