Set 1,200 years before the events of the original hit fantasy series, The Witcher: Blood Origin presents a major event in the show's lore, as it follows a group of warriors and mages who seek vengeance in the wake of a coup on the elven Continent. To bring the story to life, the prequel miniseries, which premiered on Christmas 2022, cast a group of up-and-coming stars as well as esteemed actors. Read on to meet the faces behind the engrossing series.</p><h2 id=sophia-brown-as-xc9-ile-3>Sophia Brown as Éile</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GPwUbPSd8YCAUFVFzfRjX-1920-80.jpg><p>Éile was born into the fearsome Raven clan of Pryshia. Unable to stomach the brutality of acting as the monarchy's sword, the former warrior eventually leaves her family to become a traveling bard. She's now widely known as the Lark, and her revolutionary songs are a balm for the lowborn who live under the noble class's thumb. Though she's left her duties behind, she still uses her fighting skills to defend the helpless.</p><p><a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url="https://www.instagram.com/sophiamoniquebrown/?hl=en" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Brown</a> is a British actress who made her debut in a UK production of Sister Act the Musical.

When he betrays his clan by getting too close to the royal, he's banished and left to travel as a sellsword. Though he and Éile meet as rivals, the former clan members eventually find common ground through their quest.</p><p><a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url="https://www.instagram.com/larzogram/?hl=en" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>O'Fuarian</a> is an Irish actor who has appeared in several action series, including stints on HBO's <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/tag/game-of-thrones/>Game of Thrones</a>, <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/tag/amazon-prime-video/>Prime Video</a>'s Vikings, and AMC's Into the Badlands.

She formerly served as Éile's "swordmother" and trainer; when the bard abandoned her duties, Scían was dishonored and banished. She worked as a sellsword to survive, and she longs to be reunited with her ancestral blade, Soulreaver, which was taken by Xintrea.</p><p><a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.instagram.com/michelleyeoh_official/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Yeoh</a> is an action star who began her acting career in Hong Kong's film industry.
