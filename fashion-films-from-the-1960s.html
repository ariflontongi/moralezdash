Director Federico Fellini claimed that Balenciaga's iconic 1957 sack dress moved him to write the film, and although that dress in particular isn't actually worn in the movie, it did take home the Oscar for Best Costume Design in 1960. The film plays host to a variety of stunning fashion moments, from Sylvia's black gown at the Trevi Fountain to her white furs and the tiny kitten she totes around.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>2) Breakfast At Tiffany's, 1961</strong><br>The role which became one of Audrey Hepburn's most iconic, Breakfast at Tiffany's chronicles Truman Capote's story of Holly Golightly—the lost country-turned-city girl who doesn't seem to have anything together—besides an incredible wardrobe. Dressed by Hubert de Givenchy (one of Audrey's closest friends in real life), Holly's wardrobe includes jewels, hats, pointed alligator flats and that iconic little black dress. The movie is a nonstop fashion feast, from the opening in front of Tiffany's on Fifth Avenue to that perfect tan trench in the movie's final scene.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>3) The Graduate, 1967</strong><br>Directed by Mike Nichols, The Graduate was deemed one of the most groundbreaking movies of the '60s. Dustin Hoffman stars in his breakout film as Benjamin Braddock, a recent college graduate who doesn't know what he wants to do with his life. Enter Anne Bancroft, who plays the infamous Mrs. Robinson, the seductive wife of Benjamin's father's business partner who starts an affair with the much younger boy. The film not only symbolizes the generation gap in the '50s and '60s, but it also paved the way for film and pop culture's token "cougar." Plus, Mrs. Robinson's sultry wardobe and perfect lingerie (who could forget those iconic stockings) will inspire you to step up your own undergarment style game.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>4) Bonnie & Clyde, 1967</strong><br>Faye Dunaway and Warren Beatty star as Bonny and Clyde in the 1967 film, managing to make robbing banks look incredibly glamorous. The '30s trends, from midi skirts and hats to plenty of prints, had a touch of '60s style in this remake, which proved to be a sartorial home-run on the big screen.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>5) Belle du Jour, 1968</strong><br>The French film stars Catherine Deneuve, who plays a stylish though innocent housewife by day and a sultry prostitute by night. With costumes designed by Yves Saint Laurent, the film's fashion saw Deneuve in an array of pieces that defined the '60s style scene. From double-breasted coats, Peter Pan collars and a-line dresses to sexy lingerie, Deneuve's Séverine dresses in the best of both worlds.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>6) Blow Up, 1966</strong><br>Capturing the Swinging '60s London scene, Blow Up follows a fashion photographer (inspired by real-life photographer David Bailey) as he works with the biggest models of the day, played by Veruschka and Jane Birkin. The fashion-based movie offers a rare glimpse into the London fashion scene during its explosive beginnings.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>7) A Very Private Affair, 1962</strong><br>Brigitte Bardot stars as Jill, a newly-discovered movie star in Paris who can't seem to escape her fans and the media. When the fame becomes too much, she flees to Switzerland for privacy, where she meets Fabio (played by Marcello Mastroianni) whom she starts an affair with. Throughout the movie, Bardot's trademark '60s bombshell waves, oversized headbands and chic headscarves create the ultimate style inspiration for anyone wanting to channel the French It Girl status that the actress mastered so perfectly.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>8) Cleopatra, 1963</strong><br>Elizabeth Taylor stars as Cleopatra—a very-well dressed, luxurious Cleopatra, that is. The film's breathtaking costumes (Taylor alone had 65 costume changes throughout the film, including that iconic 24-carat gold cape) unsurprisingly won the Academy Award for Best Costume Design that year. Not only were the costumes buzz-worthy (the wardrobe budget for the film was over $190,000), but the movie spurred Taylor's tumultuous relationship with husband Richard Burton, whom she met on set.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>9) Rosemary's Baby, 1968</strong><br>Mia Farrow stars as Rosemary Woodhouse in Roman Polanski's classic horror film. Not only did Farrow's pixie become one of the most popular haircuts of the decade, but her baby doll dresses, floral prints, nightgowns and Peter Pan collars were a major wardrobe hit.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>10) The Birds, 1963</strong><br>Tippi Hedren is the quintessential Hitchcock blonde as Melanie Daniels, a socialite living in a California town that has been victimized by violent bird attacks. While the violence in this film stands out, one can't miss Melanie's wardrobe, which consists of that iconic mint green suit (still channeled in fashion collections and editorials to this day) and an oversized fur coat—which manages to look glamorous in the midst of those chaotic scenes. In fact, Edith Head's costumes almost manage to outshine the plot, as they perfectly embody the put-together style of the '60s.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>11) Valley of the Dolls, 1967</strong><br>Based on the best-selling book by Jacqueline Susann, Valley of the Dolls features a cast consisting of Barbara Parkins, Patty Duke, Sharon Tate and Susan Hayward. While the plot delves into deeper issues of addiction, depression and drama, the wardrobe of the leading ladies features a pastel palette, mini skirts, '60s bouffant hair and baby doll dresses. The film's wardrobe symbolized the youthquake of the 1960s and the desire of women to dress in a childlike, girlish manner.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>12) My Fair Lady, 1964</strong><br>Audrey Hepburn stars as Eliza Doolittle, a poor flower seller who is transformed into a member of high society. With costumes designed by Cecil Beaton, the film took home the Oscar for Best Costume that year thanks to Eliza Doolittle's lavish wardrobe. From her white-and-black ensemble in that infamous horse race scene to the movie's ending, where Hepburn emerges a lady at the embassy ball, the over-the-top costumes are not to be missed.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>13) Dr. No, 1962</strong><br>Perhaps one of the most iconic bikini moments on-screen, Ursula Andress is unveiled as the first-ever Bond girl in Dr. No. The bombshell, who became known as the ultimate Bond girl, made bathing suit history in that infamous belted bikini.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>14) Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, 1966</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Real-life on-again-off-again lovers Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton co-star in this Mike Nichols film about a couple whose tumultuous marriage falls apart. The film was nominated for 13 Academy Awards and deemed one of Taylor's best performances. While the black-and-white film had no direct correlation to fashion (aside from Taylor's luxe jewels), Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf has inspired countless pop culture and fashion references throughout the years (<u><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.harpersbazaar.com/fashion/designers/g4523/mike-nichols-designers-dress/?slide=3" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="see BAZAAR's take on Nichols' film here" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">see BAZAAR's take on Nichols' film here</a></u>)</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>15) Charade, 1963</strong><br>From the pillbox hats to the headscarves and oversized Jackie O-inspired sunglasses, Audrey Hepburn's Charade wardrobe perfectly sums up the 1960s woman. Even while on the run, Hepburn's character manages to look completely polished and put-together—reflecting how most real women actually dressed during the early years of the decade. Plus, her apres-ski style will make you want to hit the slopes immediately.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>16) Barbarella, 1968</strong><br>Jane Fonda is transformed into the ultimate futuristic sex symbol in this comedic sci-fi film. Wearing over-the-knee boots and matching bodysuits, Barbarella becomes the style icon you never knew you needed. While it wasn't a critically-acclaimed film, or even highly popular at the time, Barbarella's sleek, dominatrix-inspired wardrobe continues to be a force in the futuristic, bombshell trend—it's one not to be missed.</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/765453da-3fc9-4650-8bff-01664371711e_1704808979.png alt="Headshot of Lauren Alexis Fisher" title="Headshot of Lauren Alexis Fisher" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Lauren Alexis Fisher is the Senior Editor at Cosmopolitan, overseeing digital content across fashion, lifestyle, beauty, sex, and culture.
