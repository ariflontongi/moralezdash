Now, she is one of the most promising newer R&B singers making music. The latest news regarding the singer is that she has announced her very first tour. <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Chloe Bailey</a>’s tour is a smaller engagement than many fans would like, but it just means you may have to find a nearby state to see her in concert. She’s still winning fans, but Chloe has proven she has the talent and stage presence to headline a tour. This also means people need to know where to buy Chloe's tour tickets for the In Pieces Tour.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Chloe Bailey tour tickets go on sale soon, with dates starting in April and running until May. The tour mainly consists of theaters, which means her biggest fans will get an intimate experience with the singer and her iconic vocals. As fans know from her music videos, Chloe is also a talented dancer, which means ticket buyers can expect a full show.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">As of now, Chloe Bailey hasn't announced opening acts for her debut solo tour. However, there is still a chance she may pick an up-and-coming artist to join her on the road. Although, as she’s gearing up to release a full album, she may want to ensure the tour stops are entirely about her music as she continues to build her audience.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Here’s where to buy Chloe Bailey tour tickets.&nbsp;</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-chloe-bailey-s-tour-announcement>Chloe Bailey’s Tour Announcement&nbsp;</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Chloe Bailey announced the In Pieces Tour on February 28th. This is the Pray It Away singer’s first tour as a headliner. The In Pieces Tour will begin on April 11th in Chicago at the Riviera Theatre. It will conclude on May 3rd in Los Angeles at The Novo. The Chloe Bailey tour will only include 11 dates, so fans must be fairly quick in ticket-buying.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Though Chloe Bailey’s first album is forthcoming,</a> the singer has a wealth of solo songs to choose from for the tour’s setlist. The singer's first single, Have Mercy, shocked the music industry in 2021. Since then, she has released a number of songs, but she has decided they will not be on the forthcoming album. This makes sense, as they are now older and would date the album. But that doesn’t mean fans won’t get to see her sing songs such as Have Mercy and Treat Me. You can see the dates for the Chloe Bailey tour below.&nbsp;</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-where-to-buy-chloe-bailey-tickets>Where to Buy Chloe Bailey Tickets</h2></span><p>Chlöe attends the Los Angeles Premiere Of "CREED III".

In the age of pre-sales, the process has become much more complicated than it was even just a few years ago. Luckily, with the In Pieces Tour being relatively small and limited to the US, the process is a bit more straightforward. Her <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener" class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">official website</a> is the best way to get tickets. There is currently a pre-sale going on with the pre-sale password PRAY. On her site, you’ll find the list of dates as well as a link to either regular tickets or VIP packages. The public sale for tickets begins March 3rd at 10 am local time.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The next best way to get Chloe Bailey tour tickets is through <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Live Nation.</a> Though Live Nation is going through legal drama currently, even its process should be simple to get tickets. Live Nation also has a pre-sale going on for the In Pieces Tour. Its pre-sale lasts until March 2nd at 10 pm local time with the password CHORUS. If fans don’t want to do either of those options, they can get tickets from StubHub.&nbsp;</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-chloe-bailey-s-tour-will-support-her-new-album>Chloe Bailey’s Tour Will Support Her New Album</h2></span><p>Singer Chloe Bailey performs at the inauguration of Karen Bass, the first woman of color to serve as Mayor of Los Angeles. (Photo by David McNew/Getty Images)</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Touring is one of the best ways for an artist to promote a new album. Partly, it’s because the process puts them in front of the fans with the possibility of performances going viral through social media. In addition, it’s also much more lucrative for the artist than counting on album sales and streams alone. Chloe Bailey’s first tour is named after her upcoming album, In Pieces. She released the official first single, Pray It Away, in January. More recently, she released another song featuring <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Chris Brown titled How Does it Feel.</a>&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">As many fans are aware, both Chloe and her sister are proteges of <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Beyonce</a>. In addition, her record deal with Beyoncé’s Parkwood Entertainment and Columbia Records. Though she still hasn’t had a long-lasting hit on the charts, this backing from the likes of Beyoncé gives fans hope that <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">the album will be a solid body of work.</a> Currently, there’s an online conversation regarding Chloe Bailey not connecting with fans in the way needed for sustained success. Hopefully, the upcoming tour and album will help more fans notice the singer’s talent and stage presence.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdmaIZzg5hmrqGdopp6tbuMm6yyZZOdubCx0magp2WgnrKksdJmq6itomLBqq%2FKnqus</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-jeff-francoeur-dating-now-a-look-into-the-baseball-players-relationships-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Jeff Francoeur Dating Now?
