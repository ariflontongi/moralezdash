Is this the miracle jean that we've all been looking for? Is our lifelong mission to find the perfect pair of denim finally over? And more importantly, does this jean make good on its promise?</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Coined <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>The Wedgie </a>(a less-than-flattering, albeit cheeky, name), the jean sits high on the waist, hugs the hips, fits straight through, and ends with a cropped tapered hem. As to whether it really does flatter everyone, we sought the help of four InStyle editors and recruited a diversified portfolio of butt types that range from flat and non-existent to perfectly perky and round.

Low-rise jeans don't fit me well, so I usually opt for a mid-rise or high-rise pair, and I like my jeans to be tight."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>What are your thoughts on The Wedgie?</strong> "My first thought when I put the jeans on was that they were tight, but not tight like my go-to skinnies. These are 100 percent cotton, so there's no give when you first pull them on—something I'm definitely not used to. They're snug through the thighs and butt, and almost a little too tight at the waist (you don't want to wear these to Thanksgiving dinner). I thought I would have to order the next size up, but throughout the day they stretched out a bit and definitely became more comfortable."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>The verdict: Did they flatter your butt?</strong> "Yes.

I like to feel like I can move in my jeans but I also like to settle into them. I love jeans that are slightly cropped as well because I prefer to show off my shoes whenever possible."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>What are your thoughts on The Wedgie?</strong> "Upon first glance, I thought they would be too small, but my normal denim size fit just right. I was concerned because I could tell they were designed to mimic the classic Levi's jean, which I've tried on before in so many different varieties and was never able to find one right for me, so I just gave up. These, however, fit totally fine. I noticed immediately that they have less stretch than what I am typically used to."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>The verdict: Did they flatter your butt?</strong> "I wasn't sure when I first looked in the mirror. I feel that from the side, they actually kind of flattened it, which I was not altogether opposed to. From the back, I thought there was weird bunching on my thighs that I didn't like. But once I saw a photo of my butt in the jeans, I was pleasantly surprised. So now of course I'm questioning if in fact any of my own jeans actually make my butt look good without photographic proof."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Kelsey Glein, Associate Editor</strong></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Sarah Balch for InStyle.com</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Describe your butt</strong>: "Fairly non-existent.

Oh, how I love my butt! I used to have a flat butt when I was super skinny, but in recent years it's really come into its own, thanks to a squat routine and more cheeseburgers in my life."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>What type of jeans do you usually buy?</strong> "I normally stick to dark washes and skinny silhouettes."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>What are your thoughts on The Wedgie?</strong> "I was trepidatious about wearing such a high waist. I love that silhouette in suiting and skirts, but denim transports me back to the '90s when I wore them awkwardly in middle school and had no idea what I was doing. But I was surprised how much I liked them. In addition to the magic they worked from behind, they made my legs look longer and defined my waist. And you get instant cool girl points just by wearing them. In fact, one of the compliments I got was that I looked, 'very Brooklyn.' As for sizing, they do run a little small, so consider sizing up!"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_49-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>The verdict: Did they flatter your butt?</strong> "You mean, did they make me love my butt even more? I think they did a good job of flattering, sure. With skinny jeans, the pockets tend to be lower, which can make you look droopy back there. These have high pockets that curve slightly to follow the natural badonk of your booty.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_51-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Another key element: </strong>The seaming helps emphasize your curves. They sort of pull up in between your legs—hence the 'Wedgie'—but not uncomfortably. That gives your butt a sort of extra definition."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57zZ6urGeVmba1u9Fmq56rpJqxbrjEr6CsZaeasai1xGahnpmeqHqzsdWinLA%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./1451784-nigerian-tells-oyimbo-lady-that-mugu-means-good-woman-she-accepts-hilarious-video.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Nigerian Confuses Oyinbo Lady With Pidgin, Tells Her 'Mugu' Means 'Good Woman', She Accepts in Funny">&larr;
